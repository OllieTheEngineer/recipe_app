API I used to obtain recipe info
https://spoonacular.com/food-api
https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch

Used python and flask to create routes and to navigate through the recipe app
used wtforms to create sign up and log in forms for users to be able to log in and then search for recipes
used some jinja on html to add forms to the html.
